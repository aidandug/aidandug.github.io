            <h2>Project 1</h2>
            <p>
                The suspension geometry I'm designing in Fusion 360 includes both upper and lower control arms, 
                carefully positioned for optimal motion and balance. The lower control arm connects to the wheel hub, 
                handling the lateral forces, while the upper arm helps maintain alignment during movement. Between them,
                 I’ve integrated a coilover, which serves both as the spring and the damper. This allows for adjustments
                  in ride height and stiffness, giving me the flexibility to fine-tune the system for performance or 
                  comfort. The goal is to create a setup that maximizes handling, minimizes body roll, and keeps the 
                  car stable through corners.

            <h2>Project 2: Replacing Coilovers</h2>
            <p>
                Installing coilovers in my car was a transformative experience, both in terms of performance and driving feel. 
                The process itself was relatively straightforward, but definitely required some patience and precision to get 
                everything dialed in correctly. </p>
                <p>First, removing the old suspension took a bit of effort, especially 
                    with a few stubborn bolts, but once that was done, installing the coilovers was smooth. The adjustable 
                    height feature was a big plus, allowing me to fine-tune the stance and balance of the car. I had to take 
                    my time setting the preload on the springs and adjusting the damping to match my driving style, but once 
                    everything was in place, the improvement was immediate. </p>
                <p>The car feels much more planted now, with a noticeable reduction in body roll, especially in sharp corners. 
                    The ride is stiffer but not uncomfortable—just enough to provide a more direct connection with the road. 
                    Overall, I’m really happy with the results. The coilovers have completely changed how the car handles, 
                    giving me more confidence and control, both on daily drives and when pushing it through corners.</p>
