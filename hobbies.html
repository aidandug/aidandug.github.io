            <h2>Racing</h2>
            <p>I have always had a passion for race cars, captivated by their speed and 
                engineering excellence. Attending prestigious racing events like Formula 1 
                and the World Endurance Championship has fueled my enthusiasm even more. 
                The adrenaline rush of watching these incredible machines tear down the track, 
                along with the thrill of being part of the crowd, has deepened my appreciation 
                for the sport and the technology behind these high-performance vehicles.

        <!-- Simulator Section -->
                <h2> Simulator</h3>
            <p class="section-subheading"> 
                My hyper realistic racing simulator is one of my favorite projects, designed to give the most immersive racing experience possible. 
                Itâ€™s equipped with Buttkickers (or haptic transducers) mounted around the seat to simulate the rumble over turns, a direct drive Fanatec wheel, 
                restricting seat belts (belt tensioners) for added realism, VR goggles, and even air which is blown through tubes 
                to mimic wind. I have played multiple racing games, but races in iRacing are the most immersive by far. My go-to events are in the Porsche 963 from WEC, and 
                I love putting up competitive times on the iconic tracks: SPA, IMOLA, and COTA. Additionally, using Sparco gloves and booties add to the authentic feel. 
                The pedals are responsive and differ between cars, adding to the realism of the set up. I have two wheels (yoke and traditional) 
                which can be easily swapped when racing different vehicles. The buttons have been labeled for ease of use, despite being in VR. The simulator is equipped with 
                paddle shifters, a gear shift, and a hydro-ebrake. Furthermore, there is a mounted dash which lights up (not pictured) and displays the according dash in-game. This helps
                for viewers who want to watch laps and improve their own times through spectating. Other notable cars and tracks I enjoy are: Ferrari 296 gtb, Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992),
                Mazda MX-5 Cup, The NÃ¼rburgring, Monza, Laguna Seca, among many others.

    <div class="hobby" id="rc-planes">
        <h2>RC Cars and RC Planes</h2>
            <p>In addition to full-scale racing, I have a strong interest in remote-controlled 
                (RC) cars. Building and customizing my own RC vehicles allows me to apply my 
                engineering skills in a fun and creative way. Whether itâ€™s racing them on the 
                track or modifying them for improved performance, this hobby combines my love 
                for cars with hands-on experience in mechanics and design.

            
                <!-- Foam Plane Section -->
                <div class="foam-plane" id="foam-plane">
                    <h2> Foam Plane</h3>
                    <p class="section-subheading"> 
                        I started my journey with RC planes by building two foam planesâ€”one green, one purple. 
                        The wings were crafted from a foam mold, which I fitted with two servos for wing control, a rotor, and a lithium battery. 
                        Later on, I added LED lights along the wingspan for night flying. These foam planes were perfect for training, as they were 
                        durable enough to handle crashes, even into fences, at over 30 mph without sustaining damage. They were my introduction to 
                        high-speed, controlled flight, and they really helped me build the skills for more advanced flying.

                <div class="carbon-plane">
                    <h2 class="section-header">Carbon Plane</h2>
                    <p class="section-subheading"> 
                        Once I felt confident with the foam planes, I stepped up to RC carbon planes. 
                        Ordered overseas from a shop in Europe, these planes were hand-made with custom composite bodies, 
                        making them incredibly lightweight, fast, and agile. The craftsmanship in these planes is impressiveâ€”they 
                        feature a sleek, slim body design and multiple replaceable parts, which is great for both maintenance and 
                        upgrades. The ability to swap out components quickly made them perfect for fine-tuning flight performance. </p>
                    <p> These planes were designed to maneuver like no other, cutting through the air with sharp turns and responsive 
                        controls that demanded a higher level of skill. The precise handling made every flight both challenging and rewarding. 
                        Flying these required a deep understanding of aerodynamics and a much more delicate touch on the controls. But thatâ€™s 
                        what made them exhilaratingâ€”it was a whole new level of RC flight that pushed my skills further, offering a thrill that 
                        just wasnâ€™t possible with the foam planes.

                <h2 class="section-header">Controller</h2>
                <p class="section-subheading"> This is my Futaba T12FGA, a 12-channel transmitter that I use for controlling my RC planes. 
                    Itâ€™s perfect for the precision flying I do with my carbon planes because it gives me total control over every aspect of 
                    the flight, from throttle to pitch, yaw, and roll. The dual control sticks and all the adjustable switches let me fine-tune 
                    my inputs exactly how I need them. The large LCD screen is great for tracking real-time data and making quick adjustments on the go. </p>

                <!-- RC car Section -->
                <div class="rc-car" id="rc-car">
                <h2 class="section-header">RC Car</h2>
                <p class="section-subheading"> 
                    The RC car I have was originally a Christmas gift, but the stock components left a lot to be desired. 
                    It was slow, felt clunky, and lacked the kind of excitement I was after. The plastic drive train and gears 
                    were flimsy, which made the car sluggish and prone to breaking under pressure. It just didnâ€™t have the 
                    durability or speed I was looking for.</p>

                    <p>I knew I could get more out of it, so I started upgrading. I swapped out the plastic parts for metal components, 
                    mostly aluminum, which drastically improved the carâ€™s strength and handling. I replaced the plastic frame with 
                    custom aluminum sheets that I spray-painted green for a personalized touch. These changes made the car more durable, 
                    responsive, and fasterâ€”but I didnâ€™t stop there.</p>
                    
                    <p>I began experimenting with the suspension configuration to push every bit of performance I could out of it. 
                    Adjusting the suspension helped me fine-tune how the car handled different terrains and corners, allowing for 
                    smoother, more controlled rides. I also tackled the issue of tire ballooning, which was limiting my speed. I 
                    tried different techniques, like wrapping zip ties around the tires to prevent them from expanding at high speeds. 
                    These modifications turned the car into a high-performance machine, capable of handling more power and speed than ever before. </p>
